Matrix Manipulation Program

**********************************************************************************

Overview
This C program is designed for various matrix operations. It allows users to
create, manipulate, and perform calculations on matrices. The program offers
functionalities such as loading matrices, printing them, performing matrix
multiplication, transposing matrices, sorting them, resizing, and raising
a matrix to a power.

**********************************************************************************

Features
Loading Matrices (Command 'L'): Load a new matrix with specified dimensions and values.
Displaying Matrix Dimensions (Command 'D'): Display the dimensions of a specific matrix.
Printing Matrices (Command 'P'): Print the contents of a matrix.
Matrix Multiplication (Command 'M'): Multiply two matrices.
Transposing Matrix (Command 'T'): Transpose a given matrix.
Deleting Matrix (Command 'F'): Free the memory allocated to a matrix.
Sorting Matrices (Command 'O'): Sort all matrices based on the sum of their elements.
Resizing Matrix (Command 'C'): Resize a given matrix.
Raising Matrix to Power (Command 'R'): Raise a matrix to a specified power.
Quit Program (Command 'Q'): Exit the program.

**********************************************************************************
Usage
Compilation: Compile the program using a C compiler. For example, with gcc:

gcc -o matrix_program my_octave.c
Running the Program:
bash
./matrix_program
Entering Commands: Once the program is running, enter the commands as described above. For example:
To load a matrix: L 3 3 followed by matrix elements.
To print a matrix with index 1: P 1.
